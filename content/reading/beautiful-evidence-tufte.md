In the second book I am reading by Edward Tufte, I get the impression that Tufte is trying to counter the somewhat spartan advice offered in *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*, around maximizing data-ink and removing decorations/chartjunk. *Beautiful Evidence* is more focused on how to bring data into beautiful works of art - such as adding a simple ruler to hand-drawn anatomically correct images of various animals. The data density may be extremely low still, but the idea is that tiny changes can vastly improve the information being communicated, while still remaining a beautiful image.

## Introduction

> A colleague of Galileo, Frederico Cesi, wrote that Galileo's 38 hand-drawn images of sunspots "delight both by the wonder of the spectacle and the accuracy of expression." **That is beautiful evidence**.

> Science and art have in common *intense seeing*, the **wide-eyed observing** that generates empirical information.

> ...consumers of presentations should insist that presenters be held **intellectually and ethically responsible** for what they show and tell. Thus *consuming* a presentation is also an intellectual and a moral activity.

> The principles of analytical thinking (and thus analytical design) are **universal** - like mathematics, the laws of Nature, the deep structure of language - and are not tied to any language, culture, style, century, gender, or technology of information display. 

Analytical Design is timeless, in other words.

## Mapped Pictures: Images as Evidence and Explanation

> Explanatory, journalistic, and scientific images should nearly always be mapped, contextualized, and placed on the **universal grid**. 

> In contrast, for *exploratory* image analysis, **premature mapping** may divert the viewer, foreclose alternative views, and mask subtle detail. Analysts who explore images should try to see with fresh eyes, and to ignore and deflect mind-fogging hints and directives about what is supposed to be seen. Premature closure and viewing-to-please turns exploratory image analysis into **advocacy and marketing**. (p 45)

> Well-designed and thoughtfully mapped pictures combine the **direct visual evidence** of images with the power of diagrams: Image's representational, local, specific, realistic, unique, detailed qualities; Diagram's contextualizing, abstracting, focusing, explanatory qualities. 

> Most explanatory and evidential images...**should be mapped**, placed in an appropriate context for comparison, and located on the universal grid of measurement. (p 45)

> **Mappings help tell why the image matters.** (p 45)

## Sparklines: Intense, Simple, Word-Sized Graphics

> Sparklines are *datawords*: data-intense, **design-simple**, word-sized graphics. (p 47) 

> A single letter set in 11 point type makes 20 to 200 visual distinctions; indeed an informed eye can often uniquely identify one typeface from among thousands by examining a few letters. (p 48)

> Words visually present both an overall shape and letter-by-letter detail; since most readers have seen the word previously, the visual task is usually one of **quick recognition**. (p 48)

> The idea is to be approximately right rather than exactly wrong. (p 50)

> Moreover, the year-long daily history reduces *recency bias*, the persistent and widespread over-weighting of recent events in making decisions. Tables sometimes reinforce recency bias by showing only **current levels or recent changes**; sparklines improve the **attention span of tables**. (p 50)

> There are lots of opportunities to intensify the resolution of scientific data graphics, since many are cartoonish and low-resolution. (p 53)

> A *dotdashplot*, a redesign of the standard scatterplot, turns the *frames* into data by projecting the **bivariate scatter into univariate distributions**, shown as sparklines...dotdashplots remind viewers that knowledge of X and Y *univariate* distributions fails to provide full knowledge about their joint *bivariate* distribution.

> In general, statistical graphics should be moderately greater in length than in height. And, a William Cleveland discovered, best is an **aspect ratio** that yields hill-slopers averaging 45 deg, over every cycle in the time-series. Variations in slopes are best detected when the slopes are around 45 deg, uphill or downhill. (p 60)

> These considerations yield practical advice for choosing aspect ratios for sparklines: use the *maximum* reasonable vertical space available under the word-like constraint, then adjust the horizontal stretch of the time-scale to meet the lumpy criterion. (p 50)

> A good system for evidence display should be centered on *evidence*, not on a collection of application programs each devoted to a single mode of information...Segregating information by its mode of production, convenient and **profitable** for software houses, too often becomes a **corrupting metaphor** for evidence presentations. Why should the intellectual architecture of our reports and our evidence reflect the **chaos of software bureaucracies** producing those reports? (p 61)

> Sparklines should be printed in a **single color**, or by a judicious mix of 2 colors, or in a flat color (the ink itself is the desired color)...(p 62)

> A good way to assess a display for unintentional optical clutter is to ask "Do the prominent visual effects convey relevant content?" (p 62) 

> By showing **vast amount of data within the eyespan**, spatial adjacency assists comparison, search, pattern-finding, exploration, replication, review.

> Sparklines give us some chance to be **approximately right rather than exactly wrong**. (p 63)

## Links and Causal Arrows: Ambiguity in Action

> Nouns name a specific something; arrows and links are too often non-specific, generic, **identical**, undifferentiated, and ambiguous. (p 70)

> Perhaps information concerning links between nouns is more speculative and uncertain than the nouns, but that does justify **know-nothing designs** that make all links identical. (p 70)

> Verrocchio's annotated lines hint that *sparklines* might now and then simultaneously serve as **linking lines** conveying detailed statistic data about the character of the link (variation over time? frequency of contact? strength of link? reliability? back-and-forth influence?) (p 73)

> ...clunky boxes, cartoony arrows, amateur typography, and colorful chartjunk **degrade diagrams**. If your display looks like a knock-off from a corporate annual report or a PowerPoint pitch, **start over**. *Designs* for analytical diagrams should be clear, efficient, undecorated, maplike; the *content* should be intense, explanatory, evidential, maplike. **The metaphor is the map, not stupidity**.

## Words, Numbers, Images - Together

> **Evidence is evidence**, whether words, numbers, images, diagrams, still or moving. **It is all information after all**. For readers and viewers, the intellectual task remains constant regardless of the particular mode of evidence: to understand and to reason about the materials at hand, and to appraise their quality, relevance, and integrity. (p 83)

> Along with providing cues for recalling classical mythology, star-myths help us organize and remember the spatial locations of some stars. (p 85)

> The relevant words and image begin together, but then the relevant words continue on over to the next double-page spread. In this event, it might be helpful at times to repeat the same image near the spilled-over text. (p 91)

> In 1610 the discovery of such surface irregularities {on the Moon} was significant because Aristotle had claimed that all celestial bodies were perfect, smooth, and without blemish (unlike the wretch Earth)...Galileo later questioned why religious faith need depend on the presence or absence of craters on the moon or, indeed, other astronomical observations. (p 98)

> Before 1610, astronomy had largely been verbal gymnastics, speculation, philosophizing, disputation. In contrast, these new telescopic images are the direct, visible, decisive testimony of Nature herself. (p 101)

> This paralllelism of Galileo and Matisse reflects the one deep communality of science and art: to show the results of **intense seeing**. (p 105) 

> Graphical displays used in scientific reports and exploratory data analysis **should not be afraid to repeat themselves**, and to play some **visual variations around the main evidence**. (p 108)

> Galileo makes no distinction among words, diagrams, images. Evidence is evidence. (p 109)

"The things that so often vexed the minds of the ancient philosophers

And fruitlessly disturb the schools with noisy debate

We see right before our eyes, since mathematics drives away the cloud." - Edmund Halley (1687)

> Ganged and segregated engravings have proved convenient to certain nonreaders. A common fate of separate pages of engravings in old books has been for some dealers in antiquarian prints to slice the engravings out of the original book, frame them, and sell them off - in the ultimate segregation of image and text. It is fine to appreciate physics drawings as art objects. It is even finer to know **what they mean and who thought them up**, and to keep the relevant images with the relevant words forever. (p 111)

> For Newton's *Opticks*, bureaucracies of presentation and mechanical reproduction corrupted the understanding of the content. You're lucky if they don't. (p 111) 

> Clutter calls for a **design solution**, not a content reduction. (p 120)

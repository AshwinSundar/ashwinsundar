I was first introduced to the concept of "total work" by Andrew Taggart's excellent article [The Secret to Office Happiness Isn't Working Less - it's Caring Less](https://web.archive.org/web/20170810035800/https://qz.com/1048352/the-secret-to-office-happiness-isnt-working-less-its-caring-less/).

"Total Work" is a state of existence where every activity of the modern worker's day is either work, or in service of work. Even "leisure" activities are pondered in terms of how maximally leisurely they are, and how much they refresh the worker to prepare for the work week again. 

Leisure, it seems, is a more enlightened and intentional state than idleness, and one is permitted to conduct work-like activities while in a leisurely state, from what I understand. But then this seems to break down as leisure is supposed to be defined as independent of the concept of work. If two individuals are doing the same task, and it appears from the outside to be work, but one is doing it with a "leisurely" state of mind, then is only one of them actually doing work? It appears to be the case, from my reading so far.

I read the first few chapters of this book while on vacation at a homestay in Kerala, South India. This state has been ruled by the Communist (Marxist) party of India since independence, and has enjoyed much better human development outcomes than much of the rest of India[^kerala-hdi]. There was perhaps a sense of irony that I was raised and now work in the capitalist West, and was able to visit this part of India and enjoy an enormous difference in purchasing power. All while having the luxury to lament the "proletariat" and "total work" culture that has so benefited me personally, and has given me the time to read a book which explains all of this.

### Chapter I

> ...leisure in Greek is *skole*, and in Latin *scola*, the English "school". The word used to designate the place where we educate and teach is derived from a word which means "leisure". "School" does not, properly speaking, mean school, but **leisure**. (p. 20)

> ...the Christian and Western conception of the contemplative life is closely linked to the Aristotelian notion of leisure. It is also to be observed that this is the source of the distinction between the *artes liberales* and the *artes serviles*, the liberal arts and servile work...we still speak of "servile work" as unsuitable on Sundays and holidays. (p. 21)

### Chapter II

> Intellectual activity used always to be considered a privileged sphere, and from the standpoint of the manual worker especially, appeared to be a sphere in which one did not need to work. Within that sphere, the province of philosophy and of philosophical culture seemed furthest from the world of work. But nowadays, the whole field of intellectual activity, not excepting the province of philosophical culture, has been overwhelmed by the modern ideal of work and is at the mercy of its totalitarian claims. (p. 24)

> The Middle Ages drew a distinction between the understanding as *ratio* and the understanding as *intellectus*. *Ratio* is the power of **discursive, logical thought, of searching and examination, of abstraction, of definition and drawing conclusions**. *Intellectus*, on the other hand, is the name for the understanding in so far as it is the capacity of *simplex intuitus*, Of that **simple vision to which truth offers itself like a landscape to the eye**. (p. 26)

> That is how th ematter is put by [Thomas] Aquinas in *Quaestiones disputate de veritate*. It means to say that man participates in the angelic faculty of **non-discursive vision**, which is the capacity to apprehend the spiritual in the same manner that our eye apprehends light or our ear sound. (p. 27)

> When Kant speaks of philosophizing as a "herculean labour", he does not simply mean that it is characteristic of philosophizing; he regards the labour involved as a justification of philosophy: philosophizing is genuine in so far as it is "herculean labour". (p. 29)

In other words, Kant says that labor legitimizes knowledge work. It's a view that persists to this day in America.

> "Hard work is what is good"? In the *Summa Theologica** we find St. Thomas propounding a contrary opinion: "The essence of virtue consists in the good rather than the difficult." "Not everything that is more difficult is necessarily more meritorious; it must be more difficult in such a way that it is at the same time good in a yet higher way." (p. 31)

> ...the fixed, mask-like readiness to suffer *in vacuo*, without relation to anything. (p. 32)

> **What are the liberal arts?** In his commentary on Aristotle's *Metaphysics*, Aquinas gives this definition: "Only those arts are called liberal or free which are concerned with knowledge; those which are concerned with utilitarian ends that are attained through activity, however, are called servile." (p. 34)

> The liberal arts, then, include all forms of human activity which are an end in themselves; the servile arts are those which have an end beyond themselves, and are mroe precisely an end which consists in a utilitarian result attainable in practice, a practicable result. (p. 34)

> Is there a sphere of human activity, one might even say of human existence, that does not need to be justified by inclusion in a five-year plan and its technical organization? (p. 34)

> The worker's world, as Ernst Junger puts it, is "the denial of free scholarship and enquiry." In a consistently planned "worker" State there is no room for philosophy because philosophy cannot serve other ends than its won or it ceases to be philosophy; nor can the sciences be carried on in a philosophical manner... (p. 36)

> "I have never been bothered or asked," Goethe said to Friedrich Soret in 1830, "in what way I was useful to society as a whole; I contented myself with expressing what I recognized as good and true..." (p. 37)

### Chapter III

> *Acedia* is the "despair from weakness" which Kierkegaard analysed as the "despairing refusal to be oneself." Metaphysically and theologically, the notion of *acedia* means that a man does not, in the last resort, give the consent of his will to his own being...(p. 38)

> The contrary of *acedia*...is man's **happy and cheerful affirmation of his own being, his acquiescence in the world and in God - which is to say love. (p. 39)

> Leisure, it must be clearly understood, is a **mental and spiritual attitude**...it is not the inevitable result of spare time, a holiday, a week-end or a vacation. (p. 40)

> Leisure is not the attitude of mind of those who actively intervene, but of those who are **open to everything**...(p. 41)

> A break in one's work, whether of an hour, a day or a week, is still part of the world of work. It is a link in the chain of utilitarian functions. The pause is made **for the sake of work and in order to work**, and a man is not only refreshed *from* work but *for* work. Leisure is an altogether different matter...leisure does not exist for the sake of work. (p. 43)

> ..no one who looks to leisure simply to restore his working pwoers will ever discover the **fruit of leisure**; he will never know the quickening that follows, almost as though from dep sleep. (p. 44)

### Chapter IV

> Is it possible, from now on, to maintain and defend, or even to reconquer, the right and claims of leisure, in face of the claims of "total labour" that are invading every sphere of life? Leisure, it must be remembered, is not a Sunday afternoon idyll, but the preserve of freedom, of education, and culture, and of that undiminished humanity which views the world as a whole. (p. 46)

> ...everything must be done...to obliterate a contrast of this kind between the classes, but on the other hand it is quite wrong...to attempt to achieve that aim {via} the purely terminological reduction of the educated stratum to proletarian level, instead of the real abolition of the proletariat..."Proletarianism" cannot obviously be overcome by making everyone proletarian. (p. 49)

> To be fettered to work means to be bound to this vast utilitarian process in which our needs are satisfied, and, what is more, tied to such an extent that the life of the working man is wholly consumed in it. (p. 50)

> The "total work" State needs to spritually impoverished, one-track mind of the "functionary"...(p. 50)

> ..."deproletarianizing" would mean: enlarging the scope of life beyond the confines of merely useful servile work, and widening the sphere of servile work to the advantage of the liberal arts... (p. 51)

> And so it comes about, paradoxical though it may seem, that the proletarian dictator Stalin should say: "The worker must be paid according to the work done and not according to his needs." (p. 53)

> Thus one of the first socialists, P.J. Proudhon, was not so far wrong in beginning his work with a pamphlet on the celebration of Sunday, the social significance of which he expresses in the following words: "One one day in the week servants regained the dignity of human beings, and stood again on a level with their masters." (p. 54)

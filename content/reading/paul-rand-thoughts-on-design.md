Paul Rand wrote "Thoughts on Design" when he was only 33 years old. I came across this book (a pamphlet, really, weighing in at 95 pages, half of which are illustrations) on a bookshelf at the office today. The simple title, "Thoughts on Design", made me want to read it. 

While there are interesting quotes throughout the book, they are often paired with illustrations, and are highly context-dependent. The one quote that everyone knows, "Graphic design is not good design if it is irrelevant.", is actually the very first sentence of the book, and reads:

> Graphic design - 

> which fulfills esthetic needs,

> complies with the laws of form

> and the exigencies of two-dimensional space; 

> which speaks in semiotics, sans-serif,

> and geometrics;

> which abstracts, transforms, translates,

> rotates, dilates, repeats, mirrors,

> groups and regroups -

> is not good design

> if it is irrelevant.

In my opinion, it is not the first paragraph, but the last paragraph of the book which really resonates: 

> Even if it is true that the average man is most comfortable with the commonplace and familiar, it is equally true that catering to bad taste, which we so readily attribute to the average reader, merely perpetuates that mediocrity and denies the reader one of the most easily accessible means for esthetic development and eventual enjoyment. (page 95)

A simple variation of this that I once heard was, "play to the top of the room". There is joy in creating something great, sharing it with people, and showing them what greatness looks like. Deciding where your audience is at, and then dumbing down your work to meet them there is an insult to the audience. Everyone has the capacity to grow, to learn, to be better. Anyone who creates things in any capacity has a responsibility to do a great job, and raise the bar for everyone else.

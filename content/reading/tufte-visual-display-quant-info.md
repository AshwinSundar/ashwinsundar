> Much of the twentieth-century thinking about statistical graphics has been preoccupied with the question of how some amateurish chart might fool a naive viewer...At the core of the preoccupation was the assumption that data graphics were mainly devices for showing the obvious to the ignorant. It is hard to imagine any doctrine more likely to stifle intellectual progress in a field...Graphical excellence begins with telling the truth about the data. (*Graphical Integrity*, p. 54)

> Graphical Integrity is more likely to result if these six principles are followed: 
> 1) The representation of numbers, as physically measured on the surface of the graphic itself, should be **directly proportional to the numerical quantities represented**. 
> 2) **Clear, detailed, and thorough labeling** should be used to defeat graphical distortion and ambiguity. Write out explanations of the data on the graphic itself. **Label important events** in the data.
> 3) Show data variation, **not design variation**
> 4) In time-series displays of money, **deflated and standardized units of monetary measurement** are nearly always better than nominal units.
> 5) The number of information-carrying (variable) dimensions depicted [in a graphic] **should not exceed** the number of dimensions in the data.
> 6) Graphics must not quote data **out of context**.
> (*Graphical Integrity*, p. 77)

To me, this boils down to - proportionality, clarity, standardization, and context.

> Many graphic artists believe that statistics are **boring and tedious**. It then follows that decorated graphics must pep up, animate, and all too often exaggerate what evidence there is in the data...[this] doctrine encourages placing data graphics under control of artists rather than in the hands of those who write the words and know the substance. (*Sources of Integrity and Sophistication*, p. 79-80)

> What E.B. White said of writing is also true of statistical graphics: "No one can write decently who is distrustful of the reader's intelligence, or whose attitude is patronizing." Contempt for graphics and their audience, along with the lack of quantitative skills among illustrators, has deadly consequences for graphical work: over-decorated and simplistic designs, tiny data sets, and big lies (*Sources of Integrity and Sophistication*, p. 81)

I have heard this opinion expressed by a number of individuals at the top of their craft. Bill Hicks once said to "play to the top of the room". To me, it manifests as a belief that my audience is always intelligent and discerning, and will not fall for BS in any form. Never patronize, and never hold contempt.

> I have compiled a rough measure of *graphical sophistication* - the share of a publication's graphics that are *relational*. Such a design links two or more variables but is **not a time-series or a map**...Relational graphics have been used since 1765 are printed billions of times and ways every year; and there is evidence that twelve-year-old children understand the design. (*Sources of Integrity and Sophistication*, p. 82)

> The audience for statistical graphics is smarter than many illustrators believe. (*Sources of Integrity and Sophistication*, p. 84)

> The conditions under which many data graphics are produced - lack of substantive and quantitative evidence, and contempt for the intelligence of the audience - guarantee graphic mediocrity....It wastes the tremendous communciative power of graphics to use them merely to decorate a few numbers.
> Surely there is something to be said for rejecting once and for all the doctrines that data graphics are for the unintelligent and that statistics are boring...graphical competence demands three quite different skills: the **substantive, statistical, and artistic**. (*Sources of Integrity and Sophistication*, p. 87)

> Five principles in the theory of data graphics produce substantial changes in graphical design:
> 1) Above all else show the data.
> 2) Maximize the data-ink ratio.
> 3) Erase non-data-ink.
> 4) Erase redundant data-ink.
> 5) Revise and edit.
> (*Data-Ink and Graphical Redesign*, p. 105)

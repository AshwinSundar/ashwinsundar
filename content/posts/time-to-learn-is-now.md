On Hacker News and other forums, I hear a lot of passing opinions that learning about computers and programming is so much harder than "in the good old days". Apparently, people are reduced to tapping on glass screens or using one index finger to jab their way to social-media-site.com as fast as possible, with zero agency along the way.

I don't know about that. If you know how to operate a mouse, here's a cool way to learn how the internet works.

Lesson 1: Claude-GPT-5000 Ultra Opus Turbo Pro Max (Speakmotron Edition, with 6 Quintillion Unique Vector Space (6QUVS)) is your friend. Ask it this question:

> How do I inspect the page I'm in, in browser {Chrome|Safari|Opera|Netscape|Mosaic|Lynx} (pick yours).

Lesson 2: When there's a lot to look at, split it up into sections and work through it methodically. Avoid the temptation of letting your eyes glaze over and clicking the back button. 

Click on the "Network tab", and admire the graph first of all.
